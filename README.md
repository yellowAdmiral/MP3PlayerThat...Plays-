# MP3PlayerThat...Plays-
Its a mp3 music player I build using the tkinter and pygame libraries in python 3
There's problems , like it only reads mp3 files , and it scans a specific directory at first that probably only exists in my PC and maybe there are more problems that I'm unaware of but I will definitely make it better with time .
